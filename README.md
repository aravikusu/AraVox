# AraVox for Godot
AraVox is an plugin for Godot that aims to aid in writing dialogue for your game. It uses a syntax heavily inspired by [mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) to allow writers to easily write dialogue for your game.

I recommend checking out the [wiki](https://github.com/aravikusu/AraVox/wiki) for more information.

AraVox is made for Godot 4.

This is a WIP.
